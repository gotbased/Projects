# Projects
This real-world application focuses on secure computing principles such as cryptography, network security, and data protection. It uses third-party Python libraries to implement these principles. The main goal is to send authenticated messages to a boss using HMAC encryption.

Database Development:
Create a database using Python with DDL and DML scripts.
Ensure the table includes attributes like AgentId, AgentName, AgentAlias, AgentSecurityLevel, and LoginPassword.
Implement primary key definition for AgentId.
Create scripts that run without errors and populate the table with relevant data.

Database Interaction:
Develop a Python script with SQL statements to delete, update, and select data from the table.
Include options for limiting columns and rows in the select statements.

Flask Website:
Create a Flask website with Home, Secret Agent List, and Secret Agents Results pages.

Data Encryption:
Implement data encryption using Python and third-party libraries.

Role-Based Access Control:
Use Flask libraries like flask.session and flask.flash to implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in the website.

Database Encryption:
Encrypt and decrypt data in tables using libraries like Crypto.Cipher, Cryptodome.Cipher, or Cryptodomex.Cipher.

Frontend Encryption:
Modify the login page to encrypt and decrypt AgentName and LoginPassword.

Sending Encrypted Messages:
Utilize Python libraries like sockerserver, socket, hmac, hashlib, and pycryptodome to send encrypted and authenticated messages.
This project aims to demonstrate secure computing practices in a real-world context while leveraging Python and various third-party libraries.
